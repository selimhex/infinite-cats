# infinite cats for internet's sake
a website loading random cat pictures from [Random Cat](https://aws.random.cat/meow) with a primitive "infinite scroll".

## known issues / bugs / questions without answers
- if the browser can't load new set of images, although the links are gathered through the API, browser may try to load another set of images, this may lead to overloading.

## roadmap / maybe
- hint lightbox is scrollable if the pic not wholly in screen
- img proxy to generate smaller thumbnails to save bandwidth. (probably already exists)
- prev / next links on lightbox + support for "<" ">" keys + swipe on touchscreen

## cool stuff to checkout
- this extensive list of [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
- [chance.js](https://github.com/chancejs/chancejs)
