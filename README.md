# infinite cats for internet's sake
a website loading random cat pictures from [Random Cat](https://aws.random.cat/meow) with a primitive "infinite scroll".

## known issues / bugs / questions without answers
- if the browser can't load new set of images, although the links are gathered through the API, and browser may try to load another set of images, this may lead to overloading.
- lightbox are buggy: top part of the img is cropped, if the h/w ratio of img is bigger than h/w ratio of viewport.

## cool stuff to checkout
- this extensive list of [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
- [chance.js](https://github.com/chancejs/chancejs)
